## Republication

1. Edit smarter.rb in this repo. set url to the tag address for the latest macOS release.
2. Generate a new sha256 value. In a Homebrew formula, the sha256 field is used to provide a SHA-256 hash of the file that's being downloaded. SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value. It's commonly used to verify the integrity of data.

When you install a package using Homebrew, it downloads the file specified in the url field. After the file is downloaded, Homebrew calculates the SHA-256 hash of the downloaded file and compares it to the value in the sha256 field of the formula.

    ```console
    wget https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter-cli/releases/download/<tag>/smarter-macos-latest-<version> .
    shasum -a 256 smarter-macos-latest-<version>
    ```
